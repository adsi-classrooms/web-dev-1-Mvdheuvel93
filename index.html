					I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any
					mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to
					know what happened to the plans they sent you.

					Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Look, I
					can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
					going. Ye-ha! In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I need your help, Luke. She needs
					your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
					I'm trying not to, kid. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
					Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are
					no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our
					hands. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ The Force is strong with
					this one. I have you now. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
					Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever
					you're going. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. As you wish. The more you tighten your
					grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I'm surprised you had the
					courage to take the responsibility yourself. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I care. So, what do
					you think of her, Han?
